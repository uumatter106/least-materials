# What does this mod?
This mod allows you to get lost materials from not ores but machines.
Coal getting is painy before coal cropping.
Because if coal doesn't exist as ore in map then you cannot do many things especially for new machines that need coal, with coming new mods.
Now you are able to get coal hopely!

Hopely enough things to acquire your mindustry energy.
