# What does this mod?
This mod allows you to get lost materials from not ores but machines.
Coal getting is painy before coal cropping.
Because if coal doesn't exist as ore in map then you cannot do many things especially for new machines that need coal, with coming new mods.
Now you are able to get coal hopely!

Hopely enough things to acquire your mindustry energy.
# With v1.10.1
Menders, bridges(also for liquid), more crops are there to you.
These didn't come with v1.10.1. But this version can a leader for made updates.

# With v1.20.1

# With v1.21.3
You would have your drills! Coal Drill, Coke Drill ANDD LongLong Drill.

# With v1.23.4
There are turrets new. Turrets are cee, rke, lim, ram. They could fix your enemy problems on ground and air.

# With v1.23.9
Nad here. Nad is like to a sniper but more than sniper if you like it hopefully.

2 => New items added: actilac, brick, cnoadal, coac, coactal, coalcoc, convecoal, coxy, prc, thare
3 => effective burner added
4 => coal & telepran unloader added

=> Thare wall variants fixed.
=> Requirements of new turrets buffed with increasing.


# With v1.30.5
=> New turrets added: cuo, hypo, hortum.
=> maxItem parameters increased of: coac-crucible, coalcoc-crucible and coactal-crucible.
-> ..that prevents unstable producing of crucibles.
=> ct-bullet added.

# With v1.31.0
=> Some of known turrets has a new property: splash damage.
-> Aimed to balancing turrets (not, cee, eke)
=> Damage of nad increased, now nad shots a bit a bit a bit more quickly.

=> A turret added: ground-frog.
=> ground-bridge-conveyor and ground-bridge-conduit added.

# With v1.32.5
=> Two new projectors added: ground-projector and map-projector.

# With v1.33.0
=> Two turrets added: geo, fep.

# With v1.33.3

# With v1.34.3

=> .. You could think where do we satisfy inputs of mechanical crops via miners. Answer is hopefully you doesn't need to use crops to output to crops, this looks bad. But you would use prc-quarry (and other miners, already) to satisfy our mechanical crops hopely.
