# What does this mod?
This mod allows you to get lost materials from not ores but machines.
Coal getting is painy before coal cropping.
Because if coal doesn't exist as ore in map then you cannot do many things especially for new machines that need coal, with coming new mods.
Now you are able to get coal hopely!

Hopely enough things to acquire your mindustry energy.
# With v1.10.1
Menders, bridges(also for liquid), more crops are there to you.
These didn't come with v1.10.1. But this version can a leader for made updates.

# With v1.20.1
You would have a new energy source that burns coal!

# With v1.21.3
You would have your drills! Coal Drill, Coke Drill ANDD LongLong Drill.

# With v1.23.4
There are turrets new. Turrets are cee, rke, lim, ram. They could fix your enemy problems on ground and air.

# With v1.23.9
Nad here. Nad is like to a sniper but more than sniper if you like it hopefully.

# With v1.24.0
More turrets like eke and not.
Not is resource saver at constructing it.
Eke is grown version of duo hopely.

# With v1.25.2
Not turret now require lesser items than before.
Coal conveyor added. I hope coal conveyor is an effective one.

# With v1.25.5
Hopely added projectors, they are not-projector and proton-projector.
They would protect your base.

# With v1.26.2
Buffed projectors and renamed one of them to "Proton Projector".
Hopefully added rna and dna turrets. See them you may like hopely.

# With v1.28.1
Added black integration pieces. Each one completes a puzzle.
Black integration puzzlepieces are for making a puzzle, schematic.
You could use black integration blocks in integration of schematics, that is what did i aim hopely.
